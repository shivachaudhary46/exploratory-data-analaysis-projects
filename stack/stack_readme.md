# Stack in Python 

A stack is a linear data structure that stores itmes in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.

#### The functions associated with stack are:

- ***empty()*** - Returns whether the stack is empty or not
- ***size()*** - Returns the size of the stack 
- ***top()*** – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack
- ***push(a)*** – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack 
- ***pop()*** – Deletes the topmost element of the stack

#### Implementation using List:

- list
- Collections.deque
- queue.LifoQueue
